# Project: IoT and Web Servers

In this project, we practiced programming IoT devices and web servers, as well as data visualization. Below is a summary of the activities for each session.

## Hour 1
**Task:** Blink and basic device control  
- Blinked the board LED.  
- Turned the board LED on when a button was pressed.  
- Blinked an external LED.  
- Used a potentiometer to change the LED brightness.  
- Used the internal sensor to check the CPU temperature.  
- On button press, turned the LED on and sent data to ThingSpeak.

## Hour 2
**Task:** Weather station with connection to ThingSpeak  
- Built a weather station that collects measurement data (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
- Connected the station to ThingSpeak for data storage.  
- Created a Node.js server in the root folder for data handling.

## Hour 3
**Task:** Express server with SQLite integration  
- Implemented an Express server using Node.js.  
- Integrated a SQLite database into the server for data storage and retrieval.

## Hour 4
**Task:** Webhooks, WebSockets, and data visualization  
- Created a webhook interface to receive external events.  
- Implemented WebSocket functionality for real-time data transfer.  
- Visualized the collected data using Google Charts.
