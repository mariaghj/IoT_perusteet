# Project: IoT and Web Servers

In this course, we practiced programming IoT devices and web servers, as well as data visualization. Below is a summary of the activities for each lesson.

## 1 Lesson
**Task:** Basics of backend programming
- Blinked the board LED.  
- Turned the board LED on when a button was pressed.  
- Blinked an external LED.  
- Used a potentiometer to change the LED brightness.  
- Used the internal sensor to check the CPU temperature.  
- On button press, turned the LED on and sent data to ThingSpeak.

## 2 Lesson
**Task:** Basics of backend programming
- Built a weather station that collects measurement data (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
- Connected the station to ThingSpeak for data storage.  
- Created a Node.js server in the root folder for data handling.

## 3 Lesson
**Task:** Basics of API's and databases
- Implemented an Express server using Node.js.  
- Integrated a SQLite database into the server for data storage and retrieval.

## 4 Lesson
**Task:** Basics of frontend programming
- Created a webhook interface to receive external events.
